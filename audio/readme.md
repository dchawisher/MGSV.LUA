# MGSV:TPP audio dump

>Each archive contains a folder, each folder is named after the .sbp file extracted from its chunk#.dat archive, and contains all the assets that could be extracted. If there's something we haven't heard yet, it's right in there. As long as it could be decoded, that is.

If you want to DIY:

* use QAR tool to unpack chunk{1..4}.dat
* use RavioliExtractor to extract and convert the assets from WWISE to OGG
