# MGSV:TPP audio dump


(thanks to [/u/NoolanD](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeverBeGameOver/comments/3o8xss/huge_audio_dump/cvv1b1c))

* finding some weird commands voiced by the player character. There's "shake" and "play dead", clearly for DD. There's "Call you friends", "pick it up" and "lie to them", clearly for enemy soldiers. There's "Crouch" and "Go prone", I guess it's for Quiet. Is that stuff in the game? Did I miss that somehow?
Also, there appears to be 4 female player voices and 4 male ones.

* just like someone said before, there are soldiers saying stuff like "what's the matter, boy?" in English. That points to either dogs on FOBs or to, you know, actual boys.

* Small detail. Kaz says that one of our operatives was taken hostage. In the next file he says the operative was killed and he's taking that Side Op from the list. Don't remember a story-related Side Op like this. Llooks like normal Side Ops can be failed just by not doing them for some time. That's weird.

* Several files with Kaz and Ocelot saying something like "nuclear weapon!? We can extract it if you want". I haven't done a lot of FOBs and don't know if that line is currently used in the game, just putting it here to be safe

* Ocelot detailing the Battle Gear buddy in files 0290-0292 in vox_generic_00.sbp. "The Battle Gear is an armored weapon developed to take on hostile bipedal weapon systems. You can alter its maneuverability by changing its posture. In travel mode it's as nimble as a horse. Whereas in fire mode you can move while keeping an eye on the area in front of you. It's armed with a railgun and a heavy machinegun. If you like, we can look into adding other weapons too."

* Ocelot goes "A gun camera? If it spots you, it'll give you a lead hello". Never seen that one. Edit: it's in the game, nothing to see here.

* Kaz says "Boss... do you realise what time it is right now?". Was that supposed to play if the player stays up too late or something? Don't remember hearing that in the game. Also, Ocelot says "Quiet's gone for good, Boss. Try to let it go". Some people on this sub need to hear that one lol. Don't remember if that's in the game either.

* Ocelot says "Banana field". There's a banana field in the game? Is that in the plantation area?

* Woah, is there a way to burn Intel files? Ocelot goes "Is that the remains of the Intel file? No way to decipher it now. What now... I guess you'll have to search another outpost". Could burning story-related Intel files open up some other mission objectives with new intel files?

* Audio file with Ocelot saying that while he does speak Russian, being able to do interpretations in real time is a whole different skill and he can't do it. I don't know if that's in the game, but some people were confused as to why he didn't do the Russian interpretations. Edit: it's in the game, nothing to see here.

* Guard dogs confirmed. In file1802 in vox_generic_00.sbp Kaz says "It's a guard dog, don't get too close. Wouldn't want it to start barking. Dog's sense of smell is better than ours. And so is their night vision. Don't take any chances". Man why would they even cut this. DD's in the game, dog animations and behaviours are in the game, even enemy wolves are in the game. There's nothing left to create to add guard dogs to the game. Weird.

* Kaz: "Look at that cannon. It's like a bunker on wheels. I'd love to have that on our side, but I don't see how you could get close. If you could steal that, nothing could stop you. But make a wrong move and it'll chew you up". Is that in the game? What the hell is he talking about?

* Found an audio with Kaz talking about the FOB insurance. Is that in the game? Kaz: "A lot of rival PFs have Diamond Dogs in their sights, so I've lined us up a great deal on insurance. If you sign off on it, we'll be covered on anything lost to rival PFs. Personnel, hardware, GMP..." There you go, insurance is canon. We can stop complaining about it now.

* There's a bunch of codec calls with Ocelot talking about different stars. I guess you can call him when you look up at night lol. Nice detail.

* Finding a lot of unique audios for specific prisoners. I've never heard some of that stuff, maybe you need to carry those prisoners around to hear it. Like there's an audio with some woman who came to the area trying to fight for women's rights in the country and got captured. There are unique lines for the Pashto interpreter, for a female botanist, for some drilling technician from Saudi Arabia who was captured in Afghanistan and for a lot of other people. One woman said Venom's horn looks really cute lol. I guess all of that is in the game, it's just that nobody bothers to listen to prisoners, we just extract them right away. Man does this game have a lot of details.

* In "vox_eli.sbp" the final two are  
"I'm going to break the curse of my heritage." and "First I'm going to kill you."

* In "vox_tpp_common.sbp",  
File0020. Kaz: "The chopper carrying Chico went down, mission failed."  
File0023. Kaz: "The chopper carrying Paz crashed, mission failed."  
Edit: Raiden did appear in file 37 to 40, so maybe nothing, just GZ data.
